# ALX Airbnb Database

## Requirements

To successfully complete this project, you should:

- Have a solid understanding of **SQL fundamentals** (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`)
- Be familiar with **relational database concepts** (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization)
- Know the basics of **performance monitoring tools** (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`)
- Be able to **set up and manage a GitHub repository** for submitting your work

## Key Highlights

### 1. Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams

- Create an **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram** to model relationships and dependencies between users, bookings, properties, and reviews in the Airbnb schema.

### 2. Complex Queries with Joins

- Gain expertise in SQL joins by combining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights.
- Explore `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` for various scenarios.

### 3. Power of Subqueries

- Develop proficiency with both **correlated** and **non-correlated subqueries**.
- Learn to nest queries for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filtering users based on activity thresholds.

### 4. Aggregations and Window Functions

- Use SQL aggregation functions like `COUNT` and `SUM`.
- Dive into advanced window functions such as `ROW_NUMBER` and `RANK` to analyze and rank data sets.

### 5. Indexing for Optimization

- Identify performance bottlenecks and create indexes for frequently queried columns.
- Analyze the impact of indexing on query execution times.

### 6. Query Optimization Techniques

- Write and analyze complex queries for retrieving detailed information about bookings, properties, users, and payments.
- Refactor queries to improve execution times by reducing redundancies and leveraging indexing.

### 7. Partitioning Large Tables

- Address performance challenges with large datasets by implementing **table partitioning**.
- Focus on partitioning the Booking table to improve queries on date ranges and compare performance before and after partitioning.

### 8. Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement

- Monitor query performance using `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Identify bottlenecks and propose schema changes.
- Implement adjustments and document results.
